# PacifistOptimizations
An optimization mod designed for spigot using ignite

###### I know the code is scuffed
i don't think an optimization mod's code should be this scuffed
###### I'll make it not scuffed after I fully port lithium from yarn to uh the mappings spigot uses

*Originally designed for usage on PacifistMC*
